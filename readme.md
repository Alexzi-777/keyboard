# My highly personalized Aurora Corne 

## Intro

I'm working on my portfolio. This is a project/hobby I've spent a lot time on.

## What is this?

This is a keyboard. I type on it exclusively. Here's why:
- It's ergonomic
- It looks cool
- I write music and edit videos, the knobs are good for fine controls
- Highly customizable

## Inspiration

I wanted something fun but could also contribute to my career path. This asks for c programming, smd soldering, and microcontrollers all in an addictive, yet relatively *'inexpensive'* hobby. 

## Skillset

- **Troubleshooting:** Things go wrong. Constantly. This hobby has ~~tested~~ improved my patience. 
- **Soldering:** I've soldered more doing this than school and work combined.
- **Programming:** This is the first time I've gotten this involved with firmware like this.
- **Microcontrollers:** I've become more acquainted with the pro micro and the RP2040. Learning about GPIO pins, digital and analog stuff, serial data transfer, etc...
- **Communication/Collaboration:** Along with troubleshooting, I also reached out and helped others when I could. I also would need to be particular about asking questions to get the best responses.

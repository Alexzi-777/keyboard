## Intro

I'm working on my portfolio. This is a project/hobby I've spent a lot time on.

## What is this?

This is a keyboard. I type on it exclusively. Here's why:
- It's ergonomic
- It looks cool
- I write music and edit videos, the knobs are good for fine controls
- Highly customizable

## Inspiration

I wanted something fun but could also contribute to my career path. This asks for c programming, smd soldering, and microcontrollers all in an addictive, yet relatively *'inexpensive'* hobby. 

## Skillset

- **Troubleshooting:** Things go wrong. Constantly. This hobby has ~~tested~~ improved my patience. 
- **Soldering:** I've soldered more doing this than school and work combined.
- **Programming:** This is the first time I've gotten this involved with firmware like this.
- **Microcontrollers:** I've become more acquainted with the pro micro and the RP2040. Learning about GPIO pins, digital and analog stuff, serial data transfer, etc...
- **Communication/Collaboration:** Along with troubleshooting, I also reached out and helped others when I could. I also would need to be particular about asking questions to get the best responses.
- **3D Printing:** I convinced my wife that a 3D printer is an investment, and then proceeded to print a bunch of toys. At least I developed some CAD skills and made a simple magnetic carrying case to protect my keyboard.

## Okay, so how does it work?

You may be concerned at the alarming lack of keys. Let me explain. The standard qwerty keyboard layout is old, with roots in the typewriter era. To combat RSI, carpal tunnel, arthritis, etc..., people decided that we needed to reduce travel between keys. This is achieved through layers. This is my home layer:

Most people who make keyboards like these tailor things to their needs. For 34 keys, a lot will resemble what I have here.
1. Home row mods: By tapping or holding you can trigger keys or modifiers. I've set the timing to minimize any misclicks in config.h. This reduces pinky strain.
2. TO will toggle a layer when pressed, typically used when not typing (gaming, certain applications, etc...)
3. MO will temporarily switch to a layer as I'm holding the key, typically for accessing shortcuts, symbols, and numbers.

This is the symbol layer AKA where I keep my coding stuff: 

![symbols](https://github.com/Alexzi-777/keyboard/blob/main/00117-2025-01-08_%25H-%25M-%25S-%5BWindow%20title%5D.png?raw=true)

The left side features more common coding symbols, the right features more navigational shortcuts. It's really nice to be able to switch tabs and windows back and forth, while also tabbing and shift tabbing. 

## Cons 

I've really hyped this up so I'm going to try to walk down my excitement. Here are some cons:

### Shortcuts

Some shortcut combos become several button pressed unless the keymap or shortcut is reconfigured. For example, alt f4 requires a layer change. I rarely use function keys, so I keep them on the furtherest layer. First, I hold down alt, then I need to hold my two thumb layers to access the layer that has f4. What was normally a 2 key shortcut now takes 4 keys:

### Water Proof
It really isn't. The PCB is sandwhiched between 2 laser cut acrylic plates. I could 3d print a case, but the weight and aesthetic isn't my favorite. 

### Learning Curve / Dependence
It takes awhile to get used to the adjusted key positions, but I picked it up pretty quick. This created a new problem, I notice my fingers get confused and even fatigued on standard keyboards. I did a lot of travel work on a laptop and prefered to hook up my keyboard whenever possible. It makes things even harder when it comes to not being as fast with symbols which are already a bit troubling to type to begin with. I know, first world issues.

There is a lot more to the keymap that I simply don't plan to cover for the sake of maintaining a shred of professionality on this page.
